# Car detector

Web application using **Flask** as HTTP server and **YOLOv8** pretrained convolutional neural network.

## How does it work?

### YOLO:
1. Open a movie file and detects objects
2. Every movie frame is saved as a picture twice (one is just a movie frame, second is the same but cars are marked with rectangles)

### Server:
1. Reads images generated by CNN
2. Images are sent to the web view

## How to use it?

1. Paste the video file into the **videos** folder.
2. Change *path* in **input.json**
 ```input.json
{
  "path": "videos/my-video.mp4"
}
```
4. Run the CNN and the sever.
